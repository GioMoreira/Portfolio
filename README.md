## Overview

This is a personal portfolio page that I created during a front-end course to practice my HTML and CSS skills.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the webpage no matter the screen size (responsive).
- Interacts with links and buttons.

## My process
 My first step was setting up the color variables that I'd use along the project, as well as set the box-sizing to every element.
 I approached each section at a time, first defining the HTML strcuture, then adding the style with CSS and making it responsive.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I reinforced my knowledge in CSS, using attributes that I haven't used before (such as backdrop-filter, z-index, object-fit, transform, etc).
Along the project I got more confident about making exactly what I want with HMTL and CSS, to the point that it only takes me to check the Figma model, then I can easily represent in my code.
